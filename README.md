# fuels-dart
Dart & Flutter SDK for Fuel Blockchain. Essentially, it's a wrapper over the [official Rust SDK](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs). It's implemented with the help of [flutter_rust_bridge](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge) library.

For more information about SDK functionality and abilities, please check out fuels-rs SDK [documentation](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-rs/v0.34.0/index.html).

The project tries to stick to the same interfaces as used in the Rust SDK wherever possible.
